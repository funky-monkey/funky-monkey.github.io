  A life less complex is my journey to declutter my mind, body and house. This blog started because I wanted to write about the coachings I got to deal with my AD(H)D and the things I learned there. Iâ€™ll also write about being financially independent, how to get out of financial dept, and other things that help reduce the clutter in a world where we a constantly bombarded with consumerism and social ADHD.
